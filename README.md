# Patrick Sawyer

I am a PhD candidate in the Doctoral School of Political Science and lecturer of Political Science in the School of Politics and Governance at HSE University.

My main area of research involves the intersection between populism and conspiracy theories, as well as the way they can be used to build support for populist movements.
